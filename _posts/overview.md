Access to anyone from anywhere has been a egalitarian idealogy. Pandemic turned equal internet access into a need. It expedited the need to upgrade access to data from anywhere to anyone. 5G solution cost is high. Is Low-Earth Orbit nanosatellite technology an answer?
We study here the feasibility of LEO as an alternative to 5G.

## Background
Access to anyone from anywhere has been a egalitarian idealogy. Recently, COVID-19 pandemic turned a esoteric dream into to a need.
Two main challenges obstruct the path to reach global high-speed internet connectedness: economic inequality and location
reachability. We look at the internet reachability to remote aress. Mainly two types of high-speed internet connections exist: wired and wireless.
Wired connections are cable, DSL, and fiber. Wireless internet connections are cellular 5G/4G and satellite. These
technologies incur massive upfront investments to lay cables and build towers. A large customer base is a prerequisite to substantiate
such costs which work put scarcely populated remote areas at disadvantage. While satellite has been a solution, it
serves only low bandwidth with high latency. In this paper we evaluate internet connection over Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) nanosatellite.
Is Low-Earth Orbit nanosatellite technology an answer? We study here the feasibility of LEO as an alternative to 5G.

# Technology feasibility

We first look at a packet journey from source to destination. Describe terminals, devices, software components in the path.
1. A detailed technology usecase to illustrate end-to-end picture is presented [here](tech_feasibility.md)
2. A deep dive of LEO nanosatellite technology is described [here](leo_deep_dive.md)

## Challenges

While we are excited about the new technology potential, there is a chasm to cross before above picture comes to fruition. We identify
the challenges to surpass to attain ubiquitous equal internet [here](challenges.md)

## Favorable Conditions
Challenges exist. What are the favorable conditions and reasoable paths that encourage us?

## Applications
LEO nanesatellites bring internet around the globe with homogenous characteristics:
1. with predictable latency (<25ms)
2. steady thorughput 100 Mbps
3. 100% coverage area

We envision advancements will be in many areas especially in logistics, online learning, online health, and online banking. In depth look in [here](applications.md)

## Summary
We are affirmative that LEO nanosatellite technology can provide ubiquitous internet. The path is curvy ahead. End state is exciting with potential to better level the field for 7 billion people around the globe.
