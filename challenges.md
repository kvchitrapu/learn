## Spectrum licenses in countries

LEO satellites are already heating "Ku-band" Frequency war among major competitors (SpaceX, OneWeb, and Kepler).  It is estimated that Elon Musk’s SpaceX  (12,000 potential satellites), SoftBank-backed OneWeb (1972+2000) and a Canadian start-up Kepler Communications (140 satellites) are each claiming they were first to operate their high-speed internet orbital satellites in the Ku-band.

This will be intense competitions when LEO Satellities frequency's quest reach at global level.  However the countries which lack land-based infrastructure to provide high-speed internet, might find LEO satellites as an alternative solution. 

## Space Weather 
Space Weather is defined as variation in 

• Photon radiation
• Charged particle radiation
• Magnetic fields
• Plasma density
• and Upper atmospheric composition

in near-Earth space (LEO and GEO)
 
 Space Weather is caused by either  interaction of the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere with outputs from the Sun. 
 or Propagation of disturbances from the lower atmosphere.
 
 Solar "Magentic cycles" can cause solar magentic eruptions that can lead to faults such as  Sat/Comm inteference, GeoLocation errors, satellite tracking errors. Some of these faults can lead to  catostrophic incidents such as space debris collision, unplanned reentry, and polar flight cancellation

## Space Crowding
Due to affordability, the number of LEO Statellities circling around globe could significantly greater than current state of orbital objects.  Such an increase can cause space orbital crowding with tiny fast moving objects and potential space orbital accidents. 

Due to their proximity to the Earth's atomsphere, any glitches to LEO satelleties orbital paths can pose danger to civil aeroplanes' air space and can be catostrophic given speed at which these tiny satelleties travel.

On top, there is no clear path for reusing LEO satellites after their life expectancy has been reached. This can lead to space junk/debris. As of July 2016, nearly 18,000 artificial objects are orbiting above Earth,[33] including 1,419 operational satellites[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris]
