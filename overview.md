# Paper Outline
Access to anyone from anywhere has been a egalitarian idealogy. Pandemic turned equal internet access into a need. It expedited the need to upgrade access to data from anywhere to anyone. 5G solution cost is high. Is Low-Earth Orbit nanosatellite technology an answer?
We study here the feasibility of LEO as an alternative to 5G.

# Description
Ubiquitous internet access has been an ideal dreamt by many social activists and businesses for over a decade. Several technologies namely dialup, DSL, cable, fiber, fixed wireless, mobile wireless, and satellite. Our focus is satellite. We dissect on the reasons why satellite internet shows promise to provide ubiquitous equal internet. 

In this paper, we outline the feasibility, challenges, tailwinds and potential applicatioins with the confluence of advancements in other areas like blockchain. 

# Technology feasibility

We first look at a packet journey from source to destination. Describe terminals, devices, software components in the path.
1. A detailed technology usecase to illustrate end-to-end picture is presented [here](tech_feasibility.md)
2. A deep dive of LEO nanosatellite technology is described [here](leo_deep_dive.md)

# Challenges
While we are excited about the new technology potential, there is a chasm to cross to realize above picture. We identify the challenges to surpass to attain ubiquitous equal internet [here](challenges.md)

# Tailwinds
Challenges exist. What are the favorable conditions and reasoable paths that encourage us?

# Applications
LEO nanesatellites bring internet around the globe with homogenous characteristics:
1. with predictable latency (<25ms)
2. steady thorughput 100 Mbps
3. 100% coverage area

We envision advancements will be in many areas especially in logistics, online learning, online health, and online banking. In depth look in [here](applications.md)

# Summary
We are affirmative that LEO nanosatellite technology can provide ubiquitous internet. The path is curvy ahead. End state is exciting with potential to better level the field for 7 billion people around the globe.
